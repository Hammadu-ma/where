        // Quiz questions with explanations
        const questions =
        [
  {
    "question": "All of the following statements are false about history of Anatomy except",
    "options": ["Anatomy is architecture of the body", "The earliest Anatomy was written on papyrus", "Anatomy was first studied in Egypt", "Cutting apart is the old definition of anatomy"],
    "answer": 3,
    "explanation": "The term 'anatomy' is derived from the Greek words 'ana' (up) and 'tome' (cutting), meaning 'to cut apart'. This is its original and literal definition. The other options contain historical inaccuracies."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who is the first scholar in history of Anatomy and used the term 'Anatomy' for the first time?",
    "options": ["Galen", "William Harvey", "Hippocrates", "Aristotle"],
    "answer": 3,
    "explanation": "Aristotle is credited as one of the earliest scholars to practice comparative anatomy and is historically associated with the foundational use of the term, though he primarily dissected animals."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which division of anatomy studies structures too small to be seen with a light microscope?",
    "options": ["Applied Anatomy", "Pathology", "Microscopic Anatomy", "Ultrastructural Anatomy"],
    "answer": 3,
    "explanation": "Ultrastructural Anatomy requires an electron microscope to view subcellular structures, which are beyond the resolution limit of a light microscope used in general Microscopic Anatomy."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which one of the following is false concerning the anatomical position?",
    "options": ["Standing in upright position", "Eyes are looking ventral to the vertical plane", "Arms are at the side", "Palms directed anteriorly and lower limbs feet together", "None"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "In the anatomical position, the eyes are looking forward (anteriorly). The phrase 'looking ventral to the vertical plane' is incorrect and nonsensical."
  },
  {
    "question": "Dr. Chala takes Residents to the dissection room to teach using a cadaver. Which approach will he use?",
    "options": ["Systemic", "Clinical", "Regional", "Surface"],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "Dissection involves studying all the structures (muscles, vessels, nerves, organs) in a specific part of the body (e.g., the thorax or the arm), which is the definition of the Regional approach."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which one of the following movement is not perpendicular to the floor?",
    "options": ["Medial rotation", "Lateral rotation", "Adduction", "Abduction"],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "Adduction and abduction are movements along the coronal plane (side-to-side). Rotations (medial and lateral) occur in the transverse plane, which is parallel to the floor, not perpendicular to it."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which one of the following is not a special type of movement?",
    "options": ["Abduction", "Pronation", "Reposition", "All are special movements"],
    "answer": 0,
    "explanation": "Abduction is a standard angular movement in the coronal plane. Pronation (rotation of the forearm) and Reposition (returning a thumb to anatomical position) are considered special movements."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which one of the following belongs to the splanchnic skeleton?",
    "options": ["Heart skeleton", "Teeth", "Patella", "Hyoid bone"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "The splanchnic skeleton (or visceral skeleton) consists of bones that develop within soft organs. The teeth are the prime example, being embedded in the soft tissue of the jaws."
  },
  {
    "question": "All of the followings are pneumatic bone except",
    "options": ["Frontal", "Sphenoid", "Ethmoid", "Mandible"],
    "answer": 3,
    "explanation": "Pneumatic bones contain air-filled sinuses to lighten the skull. The Frontal, Sphenoid, and Ethmoid bones all have sinuses. The Mandible is a dense bone without an air sinus."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which term stands for 'a smooth, flat surface on a bone usually covered with cartilage'?",
    "options": ["Facet", "Capitulum", "Condyle", "Trochlea"],
    "answer": 0,
    "explanation": "A facet is a general term for a small, flat, shallow articular surface. Capitulum, Condyle, and Trochlea are all specific types of rounded articular projections."
  },
  {
    "question": "Husseln's X-ray shows the head of the Femur is driven into the pelvic bone. Which fracture is this?",
    "options": ["Colles' fracture", "Impacted fracture", "Comminuted fracture", "Greenstick fracture"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "An impacted fracture occurs when a bone is driven into another bone or into itself, which matches the description of the femoral head being driven into the acetabulum of the pelvis."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which one of the following joint is slightly movable or Amphiarthrosis?",
    "options": ["Syndesmosis", "Symphysis", "Hip joint", "Saddle joint"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "A symphysis (e.g., pubic symphysis, intervertebral disc joints) is a cartilaginous joint that allows for limited movement, classifying it as an amphiarthrosis. The others are synovial joints (diarthroses)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which characteristic of muscle tissue stands for 'Ability to respond to a stimulus'?",
    "options": ["Irritability", "Extensibility", "Contractility", "Elasticity"],
    "answer": 0,
    "explanation": "Irritability (or excitability) is the ability of muscle tissue to receive and respond to a chemical or electrical stimulus."
  },
  {
    "question": "Gastrocnemius is a ______ muscle.",
    "options": ["Fusiform", "Convergent", "Bipennate", "Quadrate"],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "The gastrocnemius muscle has fascicles that attach obliquely to a central tendon from both sides, which is the definition of a bipennate muscle shape."
  },
  {
    "question": "A collection of nerve cell bodies in the CNS and in the PNS are called:",
    "options": ["Ganglion, Nucleus", "Nucleus, Ganglion", "Tract, Nerve", "Nerve, Tract"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "In the Central Nervous System (CNS), a cluster of neuron cell bodies is called a Nucleus. In the Peripheral Nervous System (PNS), it is called a Ganglion."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which one of the following connective tissue coverings of a nerve is the thickest?",
    "options": ["Epineurium", "Endoneurium", "Perineurium", "Fascicles"],
    "answer": 0,
    "explanation": "The epineurium is the dense, fibrous outermost layer of connective tissue that surrounds the entire peripheral nerve, including its fascicles and blood vessels. It is the thickest layer."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does 'proprioceptive sensation' mean?",
    "options": ["Temperature", "Pain", "Touch", "Position"],
    "answer": 3,
    "explanation": "Proprioception is the sense of the relative position and movement of one's own body parts without using vision. It provides information about joint angle, muscle length, and tension."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which division of the Autonomic Nervous System is of thoracolumbar origin?",
